# real-time-semantic-segmentation


## This project deals with the development of a real-time semantic segmentation neural network.


### Dependencies

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or latest
- PyTorch (torchvision, tensorboard)
- PIL
- tqdm
- Sklearn (metrics)
- NumPy
- cityscapesScripts

### Dataset

For training and evaluating the model, cityScapes dataset is used. It has total of 30 classes but in this project, only 19 classes will be used and the filtering operation is done using CityscapesScripts libray.
